# The Mad Scientist Lab

A collection of plugins for [BURP](https://portswigger.net/burp) to aid in the generation of dynamic content to perform Intruder scans, written in Python, extending BURP through Jython extenders. Such plugins are fairly easy to write on demand, but the plan for the Mad Scientist Lab is to provide a ready-to-deploy toolkit for generation of fuzzing/intruder scanning data of all sorts. It also servers as a skeleton on how to write Jython Extenders.
